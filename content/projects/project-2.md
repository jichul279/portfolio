## Challenge

The existing mobile application suffered from poor user engagement rates and high abandonment during the onboarding process. Users reported difficulty navigating the interface and completing key tasks.

**Key Problems:**
- 67% of users abandoned the onboarding process
- Complex navigation structure
- Inconsistent visual design
- Poor accessibility compliance

## Solution

We redesigned the entire user experience with a focus on simplicity and user-centered design principles.
